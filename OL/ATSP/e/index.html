This is a collection of (more or less independent) graduate-level mini-courses on theoretical/mathematical statistical physics.  There are currently two mini-courses on classical systems and one on quantum systems, but I hope the page will expand further.  You can download all slides.  The material here is partly based on a graduate course that I gave at Gakushuin University.
<br>
I wish to thank Mari Okazaki for allowing me to use her fantastic illustration, which was initially drawn for <a href="../../../books/pmqmbs/index.html">my book</a>.

<h2><a name="2DIsing"></a>
Proof of the existence of a phase transition in the two-dimensional Ising model (August 2025)
</h2>
<div class="inyou">
The Ising model (more properly, the Lenz-Ising model), an idealized model of a ferromagnet, is a standard subject in classical statistical mechanics and provides an ideal setting for deeply understanding and studying phase transitions in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom.
Here, we give a rigorous proof that the most basic version --- the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model --- exhibits a phase transition.
<br>
In Part 1, we explain the background and motivation. In Part 2, we fully define the model and state the main theorems.
In Part 3, we prove that the free energy density has a well-defined infinite-volume limit, independent of the choice of boundary conditions. The spontaneous magnetization is then defined as the right-derivative of the free energy density—this is the most canonical, thermodynamically grounded definition of spontaneous magnetization.
Then, in Part 4 and Part 5, by introducing two different stochastic-geometric representations of the model, we prove the two key results of this mini-course: that the spontaneous magnetization vanishes at sufficiently high temperatures, and that it is strictly positive at sufficiently low temperatures --- that is, the free energy density is non-differentiable.
<br>
We assume a basic familiarity with statistical mechanics, in particular with the definition and use of the canonical ensemble, but no other specialized background is required. All necessary facts will be explained and proved as needed.
As for mathematics, only an elementary understanding of analysis and standard set-theoretic notation is assumed.

<h2><a name="2DXY"></a>
The absence of ferromagnetic order in the two-dimensional XY model (August 2025)</h2>
<div class="inyou">
The classical XY model serves as a model for certain types of anisotropic magnets and also as an effective model for superconductors and superfluids.
From a theoretical standpoint, it is regarded as the simplest spin system with continuous symmetry.
<br>
Spin systems with continuous symmetry exhibit behavior that is fundamentally different—especially in two dimensions—from that of systems with discrete symmetry, such as the Lenz-Ising model.
In fact, the two-dimensional XY model is known to exhibit an “exotic” phase transition called the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition.
<br>
The main aim of this mini-course is to introduce two key results: Wegner's harmonic approximation, which gives an approximate description of the low-temperature behavior of the XY model, and the McBryan-Spencer theorem, which shows that the outcome of this approximation provides rigorous upper bounds on correlation functions (and magnetization).
<br>
In Part 1, I begin by spending some time discussing general aspects of phase transitions in classical spin systems related to the main subject --- namely, the Ising model, the XY model, and the Heisenberg model.
Part 2 gives a brief but precise formulation of the XY model.
Part 3 is devoted to a careful exposition of Wegner's harmonic approximation. This is a bold approximation scheme, but I provide a step-by-step account of the calculations, which makes this part rather long.
Part 4 is the core of the mini-course: a proof of the McBryan-Spencer theorem. The theorem is powerful, yet its proof is remarkably simple.  I would say it is almost magical!
Part 5, which can be regarded as an appendix, presents a proof based on the random current representation that the correlation function decays exponentially at high temperatures.
Although supplementary, this part has its own charm.
<br>
We assume a basic familiarity with statistical mechanics, in particular with the definition and use of the canonical ensemble, but no other specialized background is required. All necessary facts will be explained and proved as needed.
As for mathematics, only an elementary understanding of analysis and standard set-theoretic notation is assumed.

<h2><a name="XYchain"></a>
Integrable and non-integrable quantum spin chains (March 2025)
</h2>
<div class="inyou">
In this mini-course, I discuss two interesting topics on the S=1/2 XY quantum spin chain.
<br>
One is the well-known 1961 work by Lieb, Schultz, and Mattis, which showed that the model (without a magnetic field in the X-direction) can be solved exactly by mapping to free fermion models.
The other is a relatively new work that shows the opposite is true for the same model with a nonzero magnetic field in the X-direction.
By extending Shiraishi's work in 2019, Yamaguchi, Chiba, and Shiraishi proved in 2024 that the model possesses no nontrivial local conserved quantities, which fact strongly suggests that the model is "non-integrable."
<br>
The present mini-course is almost self-contained.
I only assume basic knowledge of quantum spin angular momenta and elementary facts about many-fermion systems described in the standard wave-function formalism.
In particular, I do not assume knowledge of the formulation of many-body quantum mechanics in terms of annihilation/creation operators (a.k.a. second quantization).
