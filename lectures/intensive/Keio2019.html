The theory of SPT phases in spin chains wasfurther refined by Pollmann, Turner, Berg, and Oshikawa, who definedtopological indices within the formulation of matrix product states(MPS). Very recently, in 2018 and 2019, fully rigorous index theoremsthat characterize SPT phases in quantum spin chains were developed byOgata. The new index theorems apply to any spin chains with a uniquegapped ground state, and free from MPS ansatz or any unprovedassumptions. Ogata's theory makes an essential (and elegant) use ofsophisticated notions from operator algebraic formulation of quantumspin systems on infinite lattices.<p>The purpose of these lectures is to explain the essence of Ogata'sindex theorems along with necessary background. I do not assumebackground in operator algebraic formulation or in modern topologicalcondensed matter physics. You don't need to know what MPS or SPT are.Basic knowledge about quantum spin system will be sufficient.<p>Tentative plan of the lectures is as follows. On the first day, I willstart by discussing the AKLT model, a prototypical model that exhibitsHaldane phenomena, and then discuss a topological phase transitionthat takes place when we modify the model. We then introduce theformulation of MPS and discuss the index theorem by Pollmann, Turner,Berg, and Oshikawa. (I think I won't have time to discuss "physics" ofHaldane phenomena in detail.) The second day should start from acareful introduction (to the beginners) of the operator algebraicformulation of quantum spin systems. I will then try to describeOgata's index theorem in a manner which is both rigorous andintuitively clear. I wish to convince the audience of the strength andbeauty of her approach.</div></body></html>
