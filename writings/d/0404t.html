朝は７時前に目が覚めて夕方からは「おねむ」になってしまう田崎です。
<p>
どうも朦朧（もうろう）とするので何をやっていいかわからず、Rutgers の議論の延長で論文を読んだり考え事をしたりしています。
学期の開始にむけて何か準備しないといけないような気もするのではあるけど。
<hr width="60%">
リアルタイムでもごそごそと書いておりましたが、今回の久々のアメリカ出張はなんか、期待をはるかに越えて、めちゃくちゃに有意義だった。
<p>
Princeton でも Rutgers でも、みなさんがぼくの訪問をとても喜んで歓迎してくれた。
仮のオフィスやら食事まで、やたら気をつかってくださって、なんか恐縮してしまうくらい。
<p>
Princeton のセミナーでは、かの「世紀の大論文」にまとめた Hubbard model での強磁性の仕事（←ぼくの、現時点での、最高の業績）と関連する摂動展開の仕事（←これって、やってから十年くらいたつけど、未だにどこにも書いてない）について話した。

ちゃんと夜に寝て、ちゃんと早起き。
普段よりもずっと早起き。
<p>
午前中は家でメールの読み書きなどをし、午後から大学へ。
家の前も、途中の道も、大学の居室の前も、満開の桜。
天気も回復し、実に快適。
これから研究したいことをいろいろと思い浮かべると、すなおにうきうきしてくる。
少なくとも、ぼくにとってほぼ理想的な居場所があるのだから、捨てたものではない、この国も。

This visit to the US has been extremely fruitful.
I did not only have very useful and stimulating discussions, but was very much encouraged and refreshed as a scientist.
At the same time, however, it is rather depressing to think about physics in Japan, especially after the exciting days at Princeton and Rutgers.
<p>
I believe people here have not yet learned that the most important thing for a scientist is to produce good science.
Some insist on meaningless division between subfields in physics, and confine themselves within their small field.
Big universities, including (or, especially) the most prestigious one, seem to regard that the major aim of their faculty members is to let students constantly produce mediocre papers, not to challenge truly hard problems.
All these are inducing and enhancing the recent decline in the quality of researches in physics.
I think this tendency is especially clear in interdisciplinary fields like statistical physics.
Yes, I am seriously worried about the future of statistical physics in Japan; it is almost dying now, and there seems to be no way of stopping this tendency right away.
<p>
Bad weather at Narita,  long waiting lines at the immigration, old guys occupying seats in Sky-Liner without reservations --- all these enhance my depression.

Back to Princeton, good old Princeton.
<p>
Some more useful discussions and conversations.

It's the day I tell you about my great grand mother (since it's her birthday), but let me do that after going back to Japan and switching back to the japanese mode.
<hr width="60%">
Last night I was at Prof. Y. Sinai's house for dinner.
<p class="senmon">
I believe I don't have to explain who he is to any of you who know something about statistical mechanics, probability, or dynamical systems.
It is this Sinai!
<p>
Of course he does not know me well, and I was invited there almost accidentally.
Perhaps he happened to be inviting those persons who are in touch with me now, and they kindly arranged me to join them.
In any case I was very much surprised to hear this invitation.
(I was simply thinking about having dinner alone at a local not-expensive restaurant.)
According to Herbert Spohn,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That kind of danger is always waiting you at Princeton.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
In Professor Sinai's house, there were Prof. and Mrs. Sinai, Prof. and Mrs. Lebowitz, Prof. Lieb, Prof. Spohn, 
<br><br><br><br>
and me.
<p>
I was the only kid --- not only according to the age, but also as a scientist.
(I will try to improve the latter.)
<p>
Anyway it was a great night and there were a lot of interesting conversation.
I also very much enjoyed their Russian food.
Since Mrs. Sinai aggressively served us, and the food was so nice,  I felt that I had had about the twice of my limit.  (Now it's morning, but I am not quite hungry.)
<hr width="60%">
Math Phys Seminar at Rutgers. "Steady State Thermodynamics"
<p>
A great audience, including Joel Lebowitz, Herbert Spohn, Gene Speer, and more.
<p>
The seminar went on in a very lively atmosphere, which I loved very much.
This time, I found myself not at all nervous.
I think I was as positive, aggressive and fluent as possible.
<p>
I was also happy to find Herbert liked the talk.  
Of course Joel is interested in it, and basically encourages us to look for a new direction.
We are having very useful discussions.
(Yesterday we had an intensive discussion about what Raphael and I are doing now.
It seems more likely that the d=1 model generically has a long-range correlation.)
<hr width="60%">
Tomorrow I'll go back to Princeton, and will visit my friend there in the afternoon.
<p>
I am taking my flight back to Japan the day after tomorrow.
